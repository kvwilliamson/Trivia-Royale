# Trivia Royale - Final Updates ✅

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Crown Icon** 👑 (Royale Theme)
**Changed:** Game controller emoji (🎮)  
**To:** Crown emoji (👑)  
**Why:** Matches the "Trivia **Royale**" name perfectly and creates a consistent royal theme

**Updated Screens:**
- Number of Rounds selection screen
- Number of Teams selection screen (kept team emoji 👥 as it's still appropriate)

### 2. **Fixed Music Path** 🎵
**Issue:** Title screen intro music wasn't playing  
**Fixed:** Updated path from `TriviaRoyaleTheme(2).mp3` to `audio/TriviaRoyaleTheme(2).mp3`  
**Result:** Music now plays correctly on title screen

### 3. **Fixed Background Image Path** 🖼️
**Issue:** Title screen background wasn't showing  
**Fixed:** Updated path to `images/backgrounds/TriviaRoyaleScene(2).jpg`  
**Result:** Background image now displays correctly

## Current Icon Usage:

| Screen | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| Rounds Selection | 👑 | Crown - Royale theme |
| Teams Selection | 👥 | People - Teams |
| During Gameplay | ✓/✗ | Checkmark/X - Correct/Wrong |
| Progress | 📊 | (Text-based progress bar) |

## Consistent Theme:

The crown icon (👑) perfectly represents:
- **Royale** in "Trivia Royale"
- **Excellence** and competition
- **Achievement** and victory
- **Premium** quality game

Much more fitting than a generic game controller!
